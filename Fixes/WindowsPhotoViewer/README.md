Restore Windows Photo Viewer
============================

Run the .reg file or import .xml file as a computer group policy registry
preference to restore the original photo viewer on a new Windows 10
installation. This is not necessary if Windows 10 was installed as an upgrade to
Windows 8.1 or 7.
